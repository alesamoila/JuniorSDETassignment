# JuniorSDETassignment

I made my application using the template from https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-mocha-webdriverio-template
Most of my work can be found at spec/example.spec.ts

My application opens correctly bayut.com but I can't access the fields from the page. It's my first time creating automated tests and probably I should have invested more time learning how to do it.
